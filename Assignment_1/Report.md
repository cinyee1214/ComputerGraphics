Exercise 1:
Implemented based on the Graham's scan algorithm. The result is shown as ./img/convex-hull.png, output is ./data/output.obj.

Exercise 2:
Used the ray tracing algorithm and count the number of intersections between the ray and polygon edges. The result is shown as ./img/points_in_polygon.png, output is ./data/result.xyz.

The code compiles and runs successfully on my MacBook Pro (M1).
